# roft
An orthogonal fine-tuning method based on rotation transformation.

The implementation of the RoFT layer is provided, allowing users to replace the linear layers they wish to fine-tune for customization. 

The RoFT is planned to be integrated into the PEFT library of Hugging Face in the future.
